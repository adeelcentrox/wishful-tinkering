## Key Concepts:

**The Fiddle Game:**
- One of 7 types of lies a person can tell
- Designed to benefit from other liars
- Con men have used for centuries
- Author's upgrades allow honest people to use it too

**Core Philosophy:**
- You can't give what you don't have
- You cannot be a reliable source of empowerment without having power to give
- Before choosing to love another, first need to love yourself
- One's generosity is only as good as one's fortune

**Alcoholic Father Counter-Example:**
- Father had little self-love but gave it to children
- May have sacrificed his own love for those deemed more important
- This creates a spiral - less self-love = more sacrifice = feeling like lost cause
- It was his choice, not the family's

**The Running Question:**
> "Are you here to run towards something, like a goal, or are you just running away?"
> "Most of all, it hurts to just be 'you'."
> "running, running, running - You're always running, and you always have been."

**Author's Promise:**
> "I want you to be at peace, to not need to distract yourself from feelings of guilt, or of shame, or of a need for ambition."
> "Without even knowing you, I can bet 10 to 1 that you are worth loving, even if you can't prove that fact to yourself yet."
> "Why do you think this book is free to read?"
