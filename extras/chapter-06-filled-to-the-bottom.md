## Key Concepts:

**The Cookie Jar Metaphor:**
- **WHO (The Jar)** = The container, the concept, the identity
- **Whats (The Cookies)** = The contents, the facts, the measurable pieces
- A jar made of diamond can contain toenails (valuable container, worthless contents)
- A jar made of feces can contain gold (worthless container, valuable contents)

**Physics vs Metaphysics:**
- Physics = Jigsaw puzzle reality (What we're dealing with)
- Metaphysics = Russian doll reality (WHO we're dealing with)
- Science answers "What is this world?"
- Religion answers "WHO is this world?"
