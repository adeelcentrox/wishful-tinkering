## Key Concepts:

**Regression Defined:**
- Reverting to child-like tendencies to avoid negative thoughts
- Uses childlike wisdom as escape route
- Doesn't require thinking about any particular What or WHO

**Spotting Regression:**
- Look for whom you're making a parental figure
- What/who fulfills the role your parents once had?
- TV as distraction (like mom singing during power outage)
- Need for unconditional love when you've "done nothing"

**Blending Child and Adult:**
- Times to play parent, times to play child
- In heated debates, becoming child is least productive
- After argument, offer hug or pat head lovingly (parental care without condescension)
- Take care of your inner child - anything terrible for your kids is terrible for you

**Key Insight:**
> "You, my friend, are just a child that has years of experience lobbed on top of you."

**Exceptions to child-like freedom:**
- When you need to play the parent in the situation
- When consequences match your WHO so well you deem it worthy of sacrifice
