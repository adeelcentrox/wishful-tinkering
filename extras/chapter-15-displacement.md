## Key Concepts:

**Displacement Defined:**
- Taking thoughts/feelings about one thing and placing them onto another
- Unlike projection, displacement doesn't involve YOUR WHO
- It's about WHOs around you, not you
- Example: Mad at work → come home and yell at family

**The Coin Toss Example:**
- Heads: $1 trillion. Tails: nothing. Would you take it?
- Add tails: "one life-altering change" - most people imagine the worst
- Odds: 66.67% positive or neutral, only 5.56% terrible (if imagining death/torture)
- Your imagination goes straight to pits of hell when given a chance

**Fear vs Uncertainty:**
- You can't be scared of uncertainty (unknown entity)
- You're scared of what uncertainty allows your imagination to create
- Brains weigh potential losses as worth nearly 2x as much as potential gains
- Sometimes things going "wrong" means they're going BETTER than you could have planned

**Key Rule:**
- Never be certain, in the face of uncertainty
- Embrace the uncertain - it lives in the unexamined parts of life
