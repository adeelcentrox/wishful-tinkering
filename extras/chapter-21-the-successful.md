## Key Concepts:

**Attraction and Repulsion:**
- Whats either attract or repel each other without emotion
- Success is a What that can be attracted by having the right Whats
- **Exponential growth**: 1 wolf catches 1 animal → 2 animals catch 2 each → 4 total
- After 16 years doubling: 65,536 units of success (2^16 = 65,536)

**The Wolf Metaphor:**
- Starting a relationship = getting first wolf to the gate
- Keeping a relationship = having enough wolves on shifts (4 at a time, with backups)
- Whats grow old and die (lose meaning over time)
- Lottery winners lose money because they only had 1 item (ticket) that tied wealth to them

**Honesty Bank Account:**
- Honesty = $1 (unless being honest when you don't want to = $10 minimum)
- Most lies = $100+ cost
- 200 truths = $200,000 in the bank
- 1 lie = -$100 drags relationship down by half
