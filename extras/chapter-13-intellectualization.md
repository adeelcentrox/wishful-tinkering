## Key Concepts:

**Intellectualization Defined:**
- Distancing two WHOs through logic and facts
- Focusing on WHAT to think rather than how you're feeling
- Using intelligence as a What to lock out emotional WHOs
- Burying emotions under "opinion or fact-based gibberish"

**The Problem:**
- Beliefs aren't you - they're yours (can change without changing yourself)
- Your shadow uses intellectualization to protect your WHO
- If based on lies, we have a problem - there are things you don't know you don't know (Neisser)

**Society's Emotion Crisis:**
- Dawn of science = emotions tossed out, replaced with pure logic
- "Sigma males" who should care for no one
- Grind-set that forgets about love, focuses on money
- Women wanting higher paying jobs whether it makes them happy or not
- Everyone impatient, ungrateful, disloyal

**Key Insight:**
- A person who prides themselves on intelligence feels need to seem like they know what they're doing
- You can't admit you're wrong if you can't identify your negative emotions
- "How can you realize that you're greedy, if you don't even keep tabs on your own emotions?"

**Regression as Better Substitute:**
- Children are the wisest among us
- Jumping from one idea to next like conspiracy theorist to avoid shame
- Try to embrace your inner child
- Simple things simply matter
