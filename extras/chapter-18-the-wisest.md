## Key Sections:

- **Page 260-261:** Pre-chapter quiz - Wisdom is using facts, not knowing them
- **Page 262-263:** Wisdom as action - if 1 Intellect + 1 Intellect = 2 Intellect, then wisdom is the action of adding
- **Page 264-265:** IQ tests only measure answers, not processes - they measure What to think, not How to think
- **Page 266-267:** Wisdom is fluid movement of the mind, intellect is solid facts
- **Page 268-269:** Too much focus on intellect slows wisdom (cement mix metaphor)
- **Page 269-270:** Children are the wisest - author's autism and how he developed different type of wisdom

## Key Quote:

> "Wisdom is not a thing to be measured directly; It's an action. You may be saying, 'But Author, actions CAN be measured.'... Not directly."

## Key Concepts:

**Wisdom vs Intellect:**
- **Wisdom** = Action of moving mental building blocks, creating new connections
- **Intellect** = The facts, the building blocks themselves
- Wisdom can lead to intellect, but intellect doesn't easily lead to wisdom
- 1 Intellect + 1 Intellect = 2 Intellect (Wisdom is the action of adding)

**The Cement Mix Metaphor:**
- Wisdom is like water - fluid, moving
- Intellect is like cement mix - solid, unchanging
- Too much intellect without wisdom = hardened, immovable mind
- Best ratio: Enough wisdom to keep intellect fluid and adaptable

**Children as Wisest:**
- Born with absolute wisdom but no intellect
- Use small amounts of intelligence to become fully functioning adults
- Childhood wisdom is like a sledgehammer - powerful and direct
