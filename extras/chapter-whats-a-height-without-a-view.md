## Key Concepts:

**Layers of Observation:**
- Most people observe: Whats → What you are → WHO you are (bottom-up, uphill, leads to prejudice)
- Better to observe: WHO you are → What you are → Whats (top-down, easier, more accurate)

**Relationships as Containers:**
- A relationship is a jar that contains both your WHO and your partner's WHO
- Your partner's Whats are NOT your Whats, even though you're both in the same relationship jar
- A relationship can have traits (like narcissism) that neither partner has individually

**Two-Way Ownership:**
- You have a race, but your race also has a community, and that community has you
- You have a world you live in, but that world also has you
- You may have a coffee to drink, but the coffee also has you (the drinker)

**Actor-Observer Bias:**
- When you trip: you blame the floor (external)
- When someone else trips: you blame their clumsiness (internal)
- This happens because it's easier to view your own WHO than someone else's
