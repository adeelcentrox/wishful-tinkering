## Key Sections:

- **Page 1:** Life worth living - finding tools to reach out and make a good life your own
- **Page 1-2:** People fall in love for WHO you are, not What you are - listing traits doesn't make others fall in love
- **Page 2:** Passion for inanimate things - every What has its own WHO
- **Page 3:** You can't know WHO you are yet - so you can't claim to love yourself
- **Page 4-5:** Symbolism vs Personification - maybe symbolism is a subcategory of personification
- **Page 5:** Items have WHOs too - we treat products as people (author's selling philosophy)
- **Page 6:** WANTS vs NEEDS - You can NEED a What, but you cannot need a WHO
- **Page 7-9:** All decisions use both logic and emotion - survival needs emotion (fear)
- **Page 10-11:** True love means three things - you want them, want them to love you back, want them to be happy

## Key Concepts:

**Love vs Passion:**
- **Love:** For living things (people, pets)
- **Passion:** For nonliving things (coffee, cars, hobbies)
- Both work in highly similar manner - almost perfectly overlap
- Every What has a WHO - even coffee, cars, ideas

**Wants vs Needs:**
- **WANTS:** Based on feelings of desire - WHOs
- **NEEDS:** Based on logically imagined futures - Whats
- You can NEED a What, but you cannot need a WHO
- You can change what you NEED to do, but cannot change what you WANT

**Decisions Are Never Purely Logical:**
- Every choice uses both logic AND emotion
- Pros and cons list requires emotion to decide which are pros vs cons
- Survival instinct requires emotion (fear) to work
- If you WANTED to starve, you wouldn't NEED food

**True Love Means Three Things:**
1. You want them in your life
2. You want them to love you back
3. You want them to be happy

> "You don't need for them to be anything. Strangely enough, the more you stop feeling a NEED to love yourself, the more easily you will... so long as you still WANT TO."

**Need = Easy to Identify:**
- If you don't have it, you'll continue to be in pain
- If you do have it, that pain goes away
- Survival is a NEED to reach the higher WANT that is your definition of "thriving"

**Codependency = Using Others as Tools:**
- Depending on them for validation, self-worth
- Viewing partner as NEED, not WANT
- Seeing them as step ladder to place beneath you
