## Key Concepts:

**Manipulation Through WHOs:**
- Connect What path you want them to take with WHO they are
- Manipulators pretend changing Whats changes WHO (it doesn't)
- Most people use Whats as measurement of WHO they are
- Reminder of WHO someone actually is = not manipulation if true

**The Domino Effect:**
- Friend's WHO aligned with product
- Friend's WHO aligned with you
- Your WHO aligned with product
- All three connected = easy persuasion

**Spider Web Viral Effect:**
- Every person is an intersection between similar people
- Web made of guitar strings - pull at point that creates most vibrations
- Don't pull at single central point (too wound-up)
- Pull at multiple spots along small radius for all-encompassing effect

**Communities as Whats:**
- Relationships are Whats
- Communities are Whats
- Every What has a WHO
- If you know the WHO behind a community, you can change people's views on it
