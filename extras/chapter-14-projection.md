## Key Concepts:

**Projection Defined:**
- Believing others have the same flaws you ignore within yourself
- You see a reflection of yourself in others that doesn't portray them accurately
- Cheating partners often accuse their partner of cheating (paranoia from shadow)

**How to Spot Projection:**
- **Be honest** - in what you say and do
- **Note what you think** you know about someone
- **Watch for contradictions** - when they prove you wrong
- **Ask yourself**: Was the real troublemaker me?

**The Pub Story:**
- Man walks out of pub, kicks horse, stumbles, holds beer bottle
- You only know these 4 facts for certain
- Your brain fills in the rest (angry drunk? animal hater? saving the horse?)
- Violent person sees animal hater. Alcoholic sees angry drunk. You see YOU.

**Two Key Questions:**
1. "How do you know... what you think you know?"
2. "What will be the worst consequences possible if you're wrong? And can you handle those problems if they pop up?"

**Overcoming Projection:**
- Match WHO you are with WHOs of everything that you have
- Each What has its own WHO
- When both you and your Whats share the same foundational energy, you become authentic
