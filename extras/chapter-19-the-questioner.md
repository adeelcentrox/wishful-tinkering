## Key Concepts:

**Questions vs Statements:**
- Statements only work for pre-tested situations
- Questions work in untested, uncertain situations
- Intelligence = knowing WHAT to think (statements/answers)
- Wisdom = knowing HOW to think (questions/process)

**The Power of Questions:**
- Always stop on a question, never an answer
- Make the question the priority, the focus
- Questions are the keys to progress; intellect is merely placing your hands upon the gates
- Frustration from not knowing an answer leads to epiphanies

**Questions and Freedom:**
- If you can't ask questions, you're at the mercy of those who command you
- Society tells us WHAT to think, not HOW to think
- Without questions, there is no societal progress
- "Curiosity is dead, my friends, and we, in all our intelligence, are the ones who killed it"
